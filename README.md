# AdmitCard-OCR-Extractor
In a university setting, managing and processing admit cards for hundreds or thousands of students can be a time-consuming task. Each admit card contains critical information such as the student's name, PRN number, and seat number, which need to be accurately recorded for administrative purposes.

To streamline this process, we develop an automated system that:

Converts each page of the admit card PDF into an image.
Applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text from these images.
Uses pattern matching to identify and extract the relevant pieces of information.
Compiles the extracted data into a structured CSV file for easy access and management.
This automation significantly reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and ensures that student records are maintained accurately and efficiently.
